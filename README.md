# 30-Day Web Development Challenge Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of websites and projects developed over a 30-day intensive web development challenge. The goal of this initiative was to accelerate practical proficiency across the full web stack, moving beyond theoretical knowledge to tackle real-world development and deployment challenges.

## Objectives
The core focus of this challenge was threefold, designed to build a solid foundation and a proactive development mindset:

### Security Literacy: To gain hands-on experience with web application development to understand the practical implications of poor security configurations, common vulnerabilities, and defensive coding practices. This experience aims to foster a security-first development approach.

### Application Development Acumen: To comprehend the complexities and challenges inherent in developing, deploying, and maintaining functional applications, improving project management and troubleshooting skills.

### Framework Proficiency: To achieve working familiarity with modern JavaScript concepts and relevant backend frameworks (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django, etc.), enhancing full-stack capabilities.

Technical Stack & Focus Areas
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, and relevant libraries/frameworks.

Backend: Focused on exploring core concepts of a specific backend framework (e.g., routing, middleware, database integration).

Security: Emphasis on understanding and mitigating common risks like XSS, CSRF, and SQL Injection.
